	<h1>Reflection of Issues in Cataloging</h1>
We each deliberately chose to catalog one traditional resource (e.g. book, encyclopedia) and one non-traditional resource (e.g. ebook, podcast). This allowed us to experience and understand the variety and needs catalogers experience with the new and old materials circulating land of collections. We both came to a similar conclusion, but from different approaches.</p> 
From the beginner’s overall perspective, Sarah found RDA elements were easier to fulfill since the elements require general and obvious descriptive values. Most values are obviously found on the copy written on the resources physical object or instances on online catalogs (nypl, worldcat, amazon, etc.) The lack of necessary delimiter coding also makes it easier to input the RDA element data.</p> 
MARC fields’ value require more structure and representative coding to indicate particular characteristic of the object (DVD or podcast). For example, MARC indicators created a bottleneck because of the need to identify what the rest of the fields are recorded to identify.</p>
At work, April inputs all new items in our computer system, editing the MARC records indicated by our copy cataloger.  So completing and updating the MARC records is an easier for her to do.  There seems to be a logic behind it that is methodical and musing.  Even when the subfields are not in alphabetical order. MARC records can be further explored and learned on one’s own with a basic knowledge with the aid of OCLC Bibformats.</p>
But RDA is more troublesome.  The concept of Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item makes sense.  The wording in RDA toolkit is harsh.  It needs to be broken down in simpler language, or at least add more examples. The toolkit is also gangly and almost scientific.  Its purpose is to make coding more user friendly.  The kit needs to reflect that by helping librarians think how a user searches.</p>  
The project brought us more appreciation of the work behind every book.  Even when it is copy cataloging, it is a task that takes time, patience, and attention to detail. It also brought to light the difficulties of cataloging without the item in hand.  With only had four items to catalog, time spent on subject headings was still limited.  Doing this project, we focused on how the user will find the information and how will the item help the patron.  We also found how connected RDA and MARC are.  They are equalling important to a record.
