#### Source:
* 9.2 DDC Number Building: What is the rule for when the decimal comes in? For example, why in 
  Libraries + Fine arts = fine arts libraries 
  = 026 + 700 = 026.7
 OR
 Medical + journalism = medical journalism
 = 070.499 + 610 = 070.49961 (why is there no decimal between the 499 and the 61 ?)
 


##### DDC practice
372.305 = science (372+ .5) serial publication (t1-05)

505 = science (50) + serial publication (t1-05)

t1-03 = dictionary + 20 = religion
