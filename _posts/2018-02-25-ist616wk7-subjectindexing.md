Fatigued this week from extended family visitors, to D's Defense, celebrations, surgeries, etc. This week is a mish mosh of things. 
Dinner table discussion with 2 retirees, one fireman retired for maybe 20+ years and one retired librarian since 2008:
Subject headings and authority control in keywords versus Google search terms and broad results. The importance of authority access and weeding out bad, unrelated content. She says "I want to go back to library school!"

Been configuring my openbox ubuntu system. Documenting updated in [this repository](https://github.com/michi-gato/openbox-ubuntu).

Need to look into the DIY approach for [Personal Digital Archiving](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2014/03/personal-digital-archiving-the-basics-of-scanning/) for ADNY's video clips. Mainly around metadata tagging for cataloging since we do not have an in-house DAM, other than our Google Drive and iCloud Photos.

Indexing machine learning programming skills... Where how what when?

Also, started this [delta.nyc](https://www.civichalllabs.org/probonotech) where I act as a Product Manager to help build a digital system for a nonprofit, [Carroll Gardens Association](http://www.carrollgardensassociation.com/). A bit nervous but something to do with CRM for community building is in my wheel house. Started this week, going until May 11th. Ruh roh.

Dr. Miller has been knighted.

### News + Links
* [This whole thread](https://twitter.com/LibSkrat/status/964515623006097411) about the pitfall of scholcomm jobs scares me
* Kinda cool that [Gothamist is back in the press](https://www.wired.com/story/gothamist-dcist-laist-return-wnyc-public-radio/)

### Preguntas Leyendo
##### Source: Taylor, Arlene G, and Daniel N. Joudrey. The Organization of Information. Westport, Conn.: Libraries Unlimited, 2009. Print. 
* Where does "other title" (e.g. subtitle) appear in pattern subject headings (600's in MARC records)?
* Review of [LexisNexis Academy & Library Solutions thesaurus tool](http://www.lexisnexis.com.libezproxy2.syr.edu/hottopics/lnacademic/proxyIndex.asp?cn=1) related to the chosen article (e.g. [Indexing Exercise](http://metadataetc.org/616/ex_indexing.html))
* In what library or archive will allow their employees to index manually (e.g. not computer-assisted)? It seems inefficient to the times.
* When is Automatic indexing practice accepted? Natural language processing and machine learning is not accurate and trustworthy enough to index content automatically enough, right?


#### Things to remember from Indexing week:
Intraindexer = re-index the article we indexed before. The number of terms assigned both times, means high intraindexer reliability.
Interindexer = 2 + people index a given article and whether or not they use the same term.
