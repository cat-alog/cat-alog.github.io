Wish I knew about speed and subtitles settings for asychronous class materials 8 weeks ago.

#### Source: 
* 8.7 Approaches in Building Classification Schemes : just-in-time (coordinated) versus just-in-case (enumerative) classification systems? 
* 8.9 How to Classify: What is the differentiate between multiple topics and aspect(s) of a subject?

##### Class share: 8.9 WebDewey Exercise: Classify at least four of the following topics and observe whether there is any pattern for the number
1. Science magazine
  * Initial basic search of "science magazine" has zero results. Then "Science" with LCSH came up with "016.505 Science--serials--bibliographies" and " 070.4495 Science--journalism" on the second page of results, but I do not know which one will be simply "science magazine". It is confusing to me as to why both science based topice have such different Dewey Decimal codes. 
  * So, 016 identifies "Bibliographies and catalogs of works on specific subjects" so 505 must be related to Science. 
  * And, "070 Documentary media, educational media, news media; journalism; publishing" while 07044 is "journalism on features and specific subjects" so 95 must be science related. 
  ISSUES: I'm still not sure which code classifies as Science magazine

2. Encyclopedia of religions
  * Searched by "Religion" with All Fields and it was easily clear that DDC 200 is Religion. 

3. Economics study guide
  * Searched by "Economics" with In All Dewey and narrowed to "330.071 Economics--education". (3 is Social science; 33 is Economics; 330 is Economics; and 330.02-330.08 includes all Standard Subdivisions within Economics.) 
  ISSUES: Could not find "study guide" specific classification DDC, but Economics--education seems like it would include study guide materials. 

4. Famous African American women
  * Searched by "african american" with In All Dewey. Most relevant result is "305.48896073 African American women, . . " but this does not specify "Famous" status. Then I found 305.48 for Specific Groups of Women, then 305.482 for Women by Social Economic Class but this left the African American topic completely and does not cover "Famous" still. 
  * Tested search by "african american women" with LCSH but the most relevant result is not accurate to "Famous African American women", instead the only semi-related result is "704.9496404608996073 African American women--household employees--art representation, . . ."
    ISSUES: Having a difficult time finding the crossover of African American Women and Famous. I get lost in the arts and culture of African American housewives or the general social and economic statuses of women.
