Four weeks into IST 616 Information and Organization and Access at Syracuse University's iSchool, and I've been spending hours on the internet looking for fellowships. I've come to the conclusion that I need to get a fellowship with a library or library organization to really delve into practice. Determined to do something about this conclusion. This morning's [I Ching (Hex 57)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hexagrams_of_the_I_Ching#Hexagram_57) told me _gentle persuasion and persistence_ is key. Sure, okay.

### News + Links
* I plan to detail this experience in a separate flushed-out post, but here's a teaser: I finally began a [huge VHS digitization project](https://twitter.com/snewyuen/status/950870344893632515) that got approved back in early January. I biked a medium size canvas tote from job in Lower Manhattan to the [Metropolitan New York Library Council studio](https://metro.org/services/599studio) in Hell's Kitchen, and received training from the very kind and knowledgeable Studio Manager, MS. Along with my intern, OB, we were able to learn, teach, and fully transfer 2 VHS tapes in 4 hours. Some snafus along the way, but those are [potentially very close to being fixed](https://github.com/amiaopensource/vrecord/issues/237). Excitement for this project is through the roof.
* Adding [Building the Unified Library Scene](https://unifiedlibraryscene.blogspot.com/) to my casual reading list. Quick skim and I dig the point of view: part-time graduate schooling and music pickings.
* Unnecessary distractions, but quite calming at the same time: New phone game, [Travel Frog](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-42871181), reminds me of a board game favorite, [Tokaido](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/123540/tokaido).

* Ch 9: Identifying Names (9.2) Why do Thai names have so many exceptions when identifying a person? The only other languages listed in exceptions was Greek, Latin, and Chinese. Something to do with scriptures, I guess, but what about Japanese and Russian?
* Ch 10: +1 to the _Identifying Families_ section including my own surname to the Preferred Name examples.
* Lecture Video 4.6: If Authority Control is also known as Access Control, is authority file, authority record, and authority work also interchangeable with access file, access record, and access work?
* Lecture Video 4.9 General Rules for the Forms of Names. I appreciate how authority/access control is normally done at the local level, not national. More effective and sustainable.
