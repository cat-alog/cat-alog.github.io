Four weeks into IST 616 Information and Organization and Access at Syracuse University's iSchool, and I've been spending hours on the internet looking for fellowships. I've come to the conclusion that I need to get a fellowship with a library or library organization to really delve into practice. Determined to do something about this conclusion. This morning's [I Ching (Hex 57)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hexagrams_of_the_I_Ching#Hexagram_57) told me _gentle persuasion and persistence_ is key. Sure, okay.

* Chapter 9: Identifying Names (9.2) Why do Thai names have so many exceptions when identifying a person? The only other languages listed in exceptions was Greek, Latin, and Chinese. Something to do with scriptures, I guess, but what about Japanese and Russian?
