### Preguntas Leyendo
#### Source:
* 9.2 DDC Number Building: What is the rule for when the decimal comes in? For example, why in 
  Libraries + Fine arts = fine arts libraries 
  = 026 + 700 = 026.7
 OR
 Medical + journalism = medical journalism
 = 070.499 + 610 = 070.49961 (why is there no decimal between the 499 and the 61 ?)
* class number + call number = book number. 
* I think my LC call number = N489 or is it N48 ?

 


##### DDC practice
372.305 = science (372 + .5) serial publication (t1-05)

505 = science (50) + serial publication (t1-05)

20.05 = dictionary (t1-03) + religion (20)
