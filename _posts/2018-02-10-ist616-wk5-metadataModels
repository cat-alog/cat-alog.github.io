_toot toot_ AJ, Lincoln Public Library District cataloguer of 6 years and current classmate, was surprised that I'm in my first MLIS course. Fake it 'til you make it, right? Credit goes to bepress for all the accessibility, DC metadata, and XML training.
I'm also in my second shift as Editor-at-Large for [dh+lib Review](http://acrl.ala.org/dh/). An easy way to reroute many of the tweets and listserv discussions I bookmark/DM to myself and instead share with the public, and then feel validated when the Review Editors actually post my recommendations. Although, I noticed that Library Twitter, listerv announcements, and article sharing has been dry this week and it's probably due to #alamw18 and all the socialness happening in mountain time.

## News + Links
* Apparently, [<u>Algorithms of Oppression<u> by Safiya Umoja Noble](https://nyupress.org/books/9781479837243/) is a *MUST* read and it is on my list inbetween class readings and fellowship hunting. [Reserved at BPL](https://borrow.bklynlibrary.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb12109340__Salgorithms%20of%20oppression__Orightresult__X7;jsessionid=4CF2CB13E75A98297F6614F87A20F093?lang=eng&suite=def).
* [vrecord](https://github.com/amiaopensource/vrecord/issues/237#issuecomment-364462365) for digitizing analog things is great. Have you tried it yet? (Two thumbs up for the community support)
* Recently discovered the [Great Suspender](https://add0n.com/tab-suspender.html) tab pause add-on to save memory space on computadora. That's fun
* Very tempted to apply for [BPL's Spring reading workshop leader position](https://careers-bklynlibrary.icims.com/jobs/1610/team-up-to-read-program-leader/job?mobile=false&width=1140&height=500&bga=true&needsRedirect=false&jan1offset=-300&jun1offset=-240). Will probably submit and just see what happens.
