Being more busy with part-time school work and full-time work work has made me more productive and apt to spend more time for self care. Unlike my two sisters who know how to relax and "do nothing" at any moment, I'm one of those people who strive off of scheduling and time restraints. Winter's are difficult to self-motivate and not lay in the warm bed and binge on Halt & Catch Fire or The Crown, but this past week has been fulfilling to the soul and mind: free exercise classes in my office building (core and yoga); visit JAR in Philly for [much music](https://www.pandora.com/artist/sam-smith/ARJ9VZwl2Plw9qZ), cooking, and [U.K. Le Guin oracles](http://www.ursulakleguin.com/ACH/Index.html); hot yoga (really great deal for [first-timers at Tangerine[(https://tangerinehotpoweryoga.com/pricing/)), and [homemade carrot cake](https://barefootcontessa.com/recipes/carrot-cake-with-ginger-mascarpone-frosting) for D-Day on Wednesday, February 21.

* [Facet Publishing's post on _Metadata â€“ have we got the ethics right?_](https://facetpublishing.wordpress.com/2018/02/13/metadata-have-we-got-the-ethics-right/) reminds me of this week's Lancaster readings on indexing, abstracts, and aboutness. Should the terms be based on [_subjective viewpoint of the author_](Crowe, 1989) or change terms according to the user needs and interests (Weinberg, 1992) or indexing _according to problems to which they seem related_ (Swift, 1987)? Besides aboutness, there's the politicized and socialized emphasis that we must continue to face in today's dystopian environment. 
* [This keynote from Code4Lib 2018](https://chrisbourg.wordpress.com/2018/02/14/for-the-love-of-baby-unicorns-my-code4lib-2018-keynote/) makes me eager to join the library world rn and makes me want to leave my current post rn.
* How can I fanangle my current position and the EcoDe9v team to be more accepting of changing their research practices so that I can join this [Expanding Communities of DH Practice program](https://twitter.com/dhinstitutes/status/964502853799772160)? Reads amazing. 
* Amongst the many upsetting current events, [this WeDieLearnGrow](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/business/the-wework-manifesto-first-office-space-next-the-world.html) is terrifying.

### Preguntas Leyendo
##### Source: Lancaster, F.W. Indexing and Abstracting in Theory and Practice
* Confused at the point that says: "the 'anamolous' state of knowledge applies more to the input side of the retreival system than it does to the output." (p. 13) versus the older-trendy misconception that "the information retreival problem as primarily on of matching the "anamolous state of knowledge" of a requestor with the more "coherent" state of knowledge of authors.. implication being that the problem lies more with system output (searching) than with input." (p.13) 
* Not really a question but according to pg. 20-21, I would be a subpar indexer. I am a slow reader. I can skim, but truth be told, I am a slow reader. If a good Indexer must be able to efficiently scan and assesss the title, abstract, list of contents, intro / opening phrase of paragraphs / chapters and conclusion, illustrations / diagram / tables / caption, words / phrases underlined or special typefaced.
* expand on _postcoordinate_, pls
